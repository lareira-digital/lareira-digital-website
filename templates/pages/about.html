    <h3>How did Lareira Digital start?</h3>
    <p>
        Lareira Digital was funded by
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oscarcarballal" target="_blank"

        on April 2022 with the idea of being an open source agency (ideally
        a free sofware one) that would promote and strengthen the open
        source and free software position not only in Spain but also in
        Europe. The idea was to have two sides of the coin. One, a corporate
        side that would put the vast years of experience to help other
        businesses and second, allow a space for software and hardware
        research and pure innovation.

        On the first few months of existence we already got our first client
        which enabled us to start delivering on the first front (software
        agency). During the next months we were able to put back some of
        that effort into our own projects, namely AVOA (IoT-Domotics) and
        Atuin (modular intranet) which try to tackle some of the problems of
        the current convoluted tech stacks available.

        During that time we also engaged in other activites of public
        interest, for example videogame development, supporting the Global
        Game Jam events alongside other efforts from the local community
        like LevelUP, MarinFest and contributing back to organizations like
        Codeberg.
