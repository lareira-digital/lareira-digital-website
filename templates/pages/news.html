            <p>#PyConES2024 has finished! It has been a blast and we are really grateful to Python Vigo and Python Espa√±a for accomodating us as sponsors of this event. As many of you know, Python is at the core of almost all out technologies and part of our company mission is to return to the community as much as possible.</p>
            <p>During the last three days we've met a lot of new people (shoutout Raiola Networks and Auth0!) and met with old aquantainces (Innatial Developers) that we consider examples of thing swe want to achieve. We've also met many new awesome candidates for our open positions and we'll be contacting them soon! We really do hope that PyConES continues on this path and that we can be sponsors again in future years.</p>

            <p>We have become members of the Codeberg e.V. organization that takes care of building a competitive european forge (codeberg.org) as well as taking care of the Forgejo project that make sit possible. Our values as a company align very well with their mission of delivering an open and competitive alternative to other platforms out there.</p>
            <p>We know that there are other alternatives out there like GitLab and SourceHut (we actually support them as well in a different capcity!) but they don't align with some of our values and requirements yet.</p>
